## Markdown syntax

This also uses [Image HTML Transform ](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/#html-transform).
The markdown sytnax for images creates the `<img>` element the plugin is looking for, and then transforms it to the `<picture>` element (if more than one format is set).

In `src/_config/plugins/markdown.js` I customized the Markdown rendering for images slightly. What normally would become a `title` attribute is used to create the caption (`<figcaption>` within a `<figure>` element). Note that I set a fixed `widths` value instead of `auto` as the default.

```markdown
![alt text](/path/to/image 'caption text')
![Close-up...](/assets/images/gallery/asturias-4.jpg) 'I used a portrait lens for this one'
```

![Close-up with unfocused background of a vibrant large blue butterfly gracefully perched on a delicate flower amidst lush green gras](/assets/images/gallery/asturias-4.jpg 'I used a portrait lens for this one')

We can also add custom attributes here ([Kudos to Aleksandr](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/eleventy-image-transform/)), to overwrite the default `widths`, have the image eagerly loaded, or add a `class` attribute, etc.

```markdown
![alt text](/path/to/image){attrs}
![Close-up...](/assets/images/gallery/asturias-2.jpg){loading="eager" decoding="sync" eleventy:widths="400" sizes="100vw" class="grayscale"}
```

As the Markdown syntax is based on the HTML Transform, we must also add a custom `sizes` attribute to the image if we want to eager-load the image.
